# If working on Mac,
# follow https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/ -- namely
# I WANT TO CONNECT FROM A CONTAINER TO A SERVICE ON THE HOST
#
# If the  Mac has a changing IP address (or none if you have no network
# access). Our current recommendation is to attach an unused IP to the
# lo0 interface on the Mac; for example:
#   sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.200.10.1/32
# and make sure that your service is listening on this address or
# 0.0.0.0 (ie not 127.0.0.1). Then containers can connect to this address.
